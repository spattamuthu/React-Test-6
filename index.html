        1.Write one example of promise.   

        let Promise = new Promise((resolve, reject)=>{  
            let a = 3;  
            if(a==3){  
                resolve('Success');  
            }  
            else{  
                reject('Failed');  
            }  
        })  
        Promise.then(console.log);
        .catch(console.log)

        2.How to solve async into sync. 

            =>Promise
            =>Promise chaining
            =>Promise all
            =>Callback
            =>Callback hell
            =>async/await

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        3.Write an example of Async/Await.  

        async function data() {
            const result1 = await new Promise((resolve) =>
              setTimeout(() => resolve("1")),
            );
            const result2 = await new Promise((resolve) =>
              setTimeout(() => resolve("2")),
            );
          }
          data();

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        4.Difference between context and redux.

        ---------------------------Context----------------------------------------

        =>It is used to share data.
        =>Changes are made with the Context value.
        =>We can change the state in it.
        =>It re-renders all components whenever there is any update in the provider’s value prop.
        =>It is better to use with small applications.
        =>It is easy to understand and requires less code.

        -------------------------Redux---------------------------------------------

        =>Redux is a state management library.
        =>It is used to manage data and state.
        =>Changes are made with pure functions i.e. reducers.
        =>The state is read-only. We cannot change them directly.
        =>It only re-render the updated components.
        =>It is perfect for larger applications. 
        =>It is quite complex to understand.
        
        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        5.What is component. Write its types.

        =>Components are independent and reusable bits of code. They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
        =>Components come in two types, Class components and Function components.

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        6.Explain the difference between functional component and class component.

        -----------------------Functional component-------------------------------

        =>A functional component is just a plain JavaScript pure function that accepts props as an argument and returns a React element(JSX).
        =>There is no render method used in functional components.
        =>Functional components run from top to bottom and once the function is returned it can’t be kept alive.
        =>Also known as Stateless components as they simply accept data and display them in some form, they are mainly responsible for rendering UI.
        =>React lifecycle methods (for example, componentDidMount) cannot be used in functional components.
        =>Hooks can be easily used in functional components to make them Stateful.

        Example:
        
        const [name,SetName]= React.useState(' ')
        =>Constructors are not used.

        -----------------------Class component---------------------------------------

        =>A class component requires you to extend from React. Component and create a render function that returns a React element.
        =>It must have the render() method returning JSX (which is syntactically similar to HTML)
        =>The class component is instantiated and different life cycle method is kept alive and is run and invoked depending on the phase of the class component.
        =>Also known as Stateful components because they implement logic and state.
        =>React lifecycle methods can be used inside class components (for example, componentDidMount).
        =>It requires different syntax inside a class component to implement hooks.

        Example:
        
        constructor(props) {
           super(props);
           this.state = {name: ' '}
        }
        =>Constructor is used as it needs to store state. 

        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        7.Write Redux Flow.    

        store.js---------------

        import {configureStore} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"
        import datas form "./slice.js"

        export const store=configureStore({
            reducer:{
                data:datas
            }
        })
        slice.js------------------

        import {createSlice} from "@reduxjs/toolkit"

        export const Slice=createSlice({
            name:"slice",
            initialstate:{name:"abi"},
            reducers:{
                update:(state,action)=>{
                    state.name=action.payload
                }
            }
        })

        export default Slice.reducer;
        export const {update}=Slice.actions;

        Home.js----------------------

        import React from "react";
        import {useSelector,useDispatch} from "react-redux";
        import {update} from "./Slice";

        export const Home=()=>{
            const state=useSelector((abi)=>abi.data);
            const dispatch=useDispatch();

            const change=()=>{
                dispatch(update("akal"))
            }
            return(
                < div>
                    < h1>{state.name}< /h1>
                    < button onClick={change}>change name< /button>
                < /div>
            )
        }


        -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

        8.What is key in a react?  

        =>A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React.
        =>Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.
        => Keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists.
